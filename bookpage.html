Maybe someone who’d been born whole and good would have put down the ash dagger and embraced death rather than what lay before me. There was blood everywhere. It was an effort to keep a grip on the dagger as my blood-soaked hand trembled. As I fractured bit by bit while the sprawled corpse of the High Fae youth cooled on the marble floor. I couldn’t let go of the blade, couldn’t move from my place before him. “Good,” Amarantha purred from her throne. “Again.” There was another ash dagger waiting, and another Fae kneeling. Female. I knew the words she’d say. The prayer she’d recite. I knew I’d slaughter her, as I’d slaughtered the youth before me. To free them all, to free Tamlin, I would do it. I was the butcher of innocents, and the savior of a land. “Whenever you’re ready, lovely Feyre,” Amarantha drawled, her deep red hair as bright as the blood on my hands. On the marble. Murderer. Butcher. Monster. Liar. Deceiver. I didn’t know who I meant. The lines between me and the queen had long since blurred. My fingers loosened on the dagger, and it clattered to the ground, splattering the spreading pool of blood. Flecks splashed onto my worn boots—remnants of a mortal life so far behind me it might as well have been one of my fever-dreams these few last months.</div>
